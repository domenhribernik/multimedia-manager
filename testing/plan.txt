Your project is a great idea! You’re addressing a clear need, especially given how unreliable and ad-laden existing YouTube downloader sites often are. There’s a lot of potential here, and with a few strategic tweaks, you could make it even more appealing to users (and stand out on your resume!).

1. **Features to Add for Greater Utility**
   Here are some possible features that would complement your existing setup without overloading it with complexity:

   - **Batch Downloading**: Allow users to input multiple URLs or a playlist to download multiple videos or audios in one go.
   - **Quality Options**: Add choices for different resolutions and bitrates, both for video and audio (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 360p for video, and 128 kbps, 192 kbps, etc., for audio).
   - **Subtitles Download & Embedding**: For those who might want to use subtitles, give the option to download subtitles and maybe even overlay them on the video.
   - **Audio Effects for MP3 Files**: Simple audio effects like volume adjustment, fade in/out, or trimming audio before adding it as background music.
   - **Presets for Social Media**: Templates for common social media formats (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts) could automatically resize and format the video.
   - **Watermark Option**: Simple watermarking could be useful for users who want to add a branding element.
   - **FFmpeg Customization**: Since you’re already using video and audio conversion, exposing basic FFmpeg customization options for users could allow them to specify format, bitrate, and codecs directly.

   Adding too many advanced editing features could push your tool into full editor territory, which, as you said, isn’t the goal. But these additions would give users more control and make your tool useful for creating quick, ready-to-upload content.

2. **Desktop App vs. Web App**
   Both approaches have pros and cons, and it largely depends on your target user and technical considerations. Here’s a breakdown:

   - **Desktop App (Current Approach)**
     - **Pros**:
       - More control over file handling, especially with large video files, since everything happens locally.
       - No server hosting costs or limitations.
       - Python and tkinter are good choices for a simple, local GUI.
     - **Cons**:
       - Users need to install Python or your app package, which might limit your audience.
       - Updates require users to download a new version manually (unless you use a packaging tool like PyInstaller or auto-updater).
       - Limited platform support compared to web apps.

   - **Web App**
     - **Pros**:
       - Easier access for users: no download, works across all platforms.
       - Can reach a broader audience more quickly.
       - Updates are instantaneous; all users get the latest version.
     - **Cons**:
       - Server costs and bandwidth issues, especially with video processing.
       - You’d need to handle file upload/download and possibly offload heavy processing to the user’s side or a cloud function, which can be tricky.
       - More complex development setup if handling video conversion, particularly if you need to integrate FFmpeg in the backend.

   - **Hybrid Solution**
     - You could create a **desktop app with a lightweight web interface** for users who prefer local control, plus a simplified web app version with some limited functionality (like just URL-based downloading).
     - This way, you could experiment with both formats and see what resonates more with users.

3. **Scalability and Open Source Appeal**
   - **Modular Architecture**: Make it easy for people to add more features or customizations. If you modularize the various functions (e.g., downloader, converter, editor), others might contribute additional features.
   - **Documentation and Usability**: Clear documentation and an intuitive UI are key. Many users would appreciate step-by-step guides or tutorials.
   - **Community Input**: Since it’s open source, consider putting a call out for feature ideas once it’s launched. This can help it grow in ways that appeal to more users without you having to build every feature yourself.

4. **Considerations for Resume Value**
   - If you go with a desktop app, make sure it’s cross-platform (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) and provides a well-documented installation process.
   - Since it’s open source, focus on code quality and modular design—potential employers or collaborators will likely examine your code.
   - Highlight your use of **FFmpeg** and **Tkinter**, which show practical skills in both video processing and GUI development.

5. **What Users Might Prefer**
   - **Desktop App Users**: Often prefer offline processing and are generally more tech-savvy. They appreciate local control and more comprehensive features.
   - **Web App Users**: Typically value convenience and accessibility. They may not want to deal with installations but would appreciate basic functionality for quick tasks.
  
Overall, a **desktop app** might be best for your initial release, focusing on users who want efficient, ad-free, and offline video downloading and editing. If it gains popularity, you could develop a lightweight web version later, with cloud storage and more limited processing to reach a broader audience.
